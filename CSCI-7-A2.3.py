#TODO:Write a program that uses Functions to print the first five verses of the Twelve Days of Christmas.
# Please include a blank line between verses, as shown below
# You should have about a half dozen functions.  Each function can include one or more print statements.
# The body of the program should call the functions you define: there should be no print statements outside your functions.
